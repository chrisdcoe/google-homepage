# google-homepage
This is a project to deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. The chosen target is the Google home page. It won't necessarily have full functionality, but it should be a good attempt at recreating it structurally and visually.

My main obstacles for this project were the strange format of the search bar and the top right image-buttons. I feel I got it reasonably close, though the drop-down effect of the search bar, the interactions with the Google account buttons, and the text-spinning effect of the I'm Feeling Lucky button won't be possible without JavaScript.
